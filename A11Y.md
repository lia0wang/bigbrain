# Accessibility

We are dedicated to ensuring that our application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. In our design, we have adhered to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), such as using alt tags for images and selecting colors that are not problematic for individuals with visual impairments.

Our accessibility efforts include:

Alt tags for images: All images are accompanied by meaningful alt tags. For example, question images have alt tags indicating that they are question images, while game thumbnail images have alt tags specifying that they are game thumbnail images.

Simple and accessible color scheme: We have employed a straightforward color scheme that is easy to read, using a light blue Tailwind bg-sky-100 as a consistent background color to create a relaxing and comfortable user experience.

Mobile-friendly design: Our application is optimized for mobile devices, adjusting the layout, components, and text size to fit various screen sizes, allowing users to comfortably use the application on any device. For example, the both admin and player session page have employed flexbox to adjust the layout of the game board and the answer board to fit different screen sizes; we made the use of tailwind css to make the components responsive to the screen size and adjust to both desktop and mobile view.

Distinguishable text: The font size and weight have been adjusted to ensure text is distinguishable from the background. We have made the question tile and
The color contrast between text and background is sufficiently high, and the font size adapts to different screen sizes for improved readability.

Keyboard operability: Our application is navigable by keyboard, with all buttons and links being focusable and operable using keyboard input. The focus order is logical and consistent across all pages. For example, users can create a new game by pressing enter after inputting the required game name.

Understandable and predictable interface: Our simple, user-friendly UI features clear labels and purposes for each button and link. All clickable elements have distinct visual feedback to indicate interactivity. Navigation buttons are labeled with clear, descriptive text to guide users, such as "Go to Admin Session." For instance, a non-registered user joining a session will see a popup modal with a text input for the Session ID and a button to redirect them to the session page. The game creation modal offers clear instructions on how to create a game, either by providing a name or uploading a JSON file. The "Download example.json" text is styled with blue color and an underline to indicate it is a link for downloading the example JSON file. Additionally, all input boxes have clear placeholders, such as "Example: 902663" for the session ID input, to guide users on what information to provide.

Robust implementation: Built using React, our application generates HTML elements through React components, ensuring that our HTML is parseable and accessible to all users. For example, the Chrome browser can effortlessly detect login and register inputs and autofill the corresponding username and password fields.
