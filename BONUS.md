- In the admin session page, when the quiz is not started, a list of users is displayed in the page like Kahoot, so the admin and users can see the users who joined the game. And the start button is disabled until there is at least one player joined the session just like Kahoot.

- User can download a example.json file from the game editing page, so they can update the game by simply follow the example.json's format and editing the content, then upload the json file to the game editing page. This makes the game editing process more convenient.
